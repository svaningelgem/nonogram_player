Now the grid splits the numbers > 9 into its own number.

But 10 is actually 1 + 0, and 11 = 1 + 1, ...

=> so what we can do is split these numbers further up (if all = white vertically => split into its own number)

Then train the network on it.
Afterwards, recombine.

Or try via OpenCV? What is the distance between those numbers?
